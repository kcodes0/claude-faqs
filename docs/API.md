Base URL: `https://api.kcodes.me/claude-faqs/v1`

This API serves the markdown FAQ corpus as structured JSON for bots and internal tools.

## Authentication

All requests require an API key.

Supported methods:

- `Authorization: Bearer <key>`
- `?apikey=<key>`

Example:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer cfaq_your_key_here" \

```

## Rate-limit headers

Every successful response includes:

- `X-Authenticated-As`

Standard keys are limited to `30/min` and `1000/day`.
Premium keys are limited to `100/min` and `10000/day`.

## Response model

Full FAQ entries look like this:

```json
{
  "slug": "account-banned",
  "question": "My account was banned. What can I do?",
  "answer": "Anthropic does not publish a public, step-by-step appeal playbook...",
  "tags": ["account", "banned", "support"],
  "category": "Account Issues FAQ",
  "category_slug": "account-issues-faq",
  "subcategory": "Bans and Suspensions",
  "subcategory_slug": "bans-and-suspensions",
  "source_file": "account-issues-faqs.md",
  "source_urls": [
    "https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9015913-how-to-get-support"
  ],
  "last_verified_at": "2026-03-10",
  "answered_by": "Jason"
}
```

Field notes:

- `slug`: stable lookup key for bots
- `answer`: markdown-friendly text; clients can render or strip formatting
- `tags`: lightweight keyword hints used for fast search
- `source_urls`: official references worth showing in your UI when possible
- `last_verified_at`: useful for deciding whether to trust pricing or support details without another check
- `answered_by`: optional contributor credit

## Endpoints

### `GET /`

Returns API metadata and the route map.

### `GET /categories`

Returns category summaries.

Example response:

```json
{
  "count": 3,
  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "Billing and Plans FAQ",
      "slug": "billing-and-plans-faq",

          "count": 5
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### `GET /category/{slug}`

Returns one category plus entry summaries inside it.

Use this if your bot has a category browser or autocomplete flow.

### `GET /entries`

Returns entry summaries, not full answers.

Query params:

- `category`: category name fragment or exact slug
- `subcategory`: subcategory name fragment or exact slug
- `limit`: max entries to return
- `offset`: pagination offset

Example:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer cfaq_your_key_here" \
  "https://api.kcodes.me/claude-faqs/v1/entries?category=billing&limit=5"
```

Summary entries include:

- `slug`
- `question`
- `category`
- `subcategory`
- `tags`
- `preview`
- `answered_by`
- `last_verified_at`
- `source_urls`

### `GET /slugs`

Returns every slug.

Useful for:

- bot autocomplete caches
- validation
- offline sync jobs

### `GET /search?q=...`

Fast keyword search over slugs, tags, questions, and categories.

Query params:

- `q`: required search query
- `mode=tags|semantic`: default is `tags`
- `limit`: default `5`, max `10`
- `format=discord`: return Discord embed objects instead of JSON entry summaries

Example:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer cfaq_your_key_here" \
  "https://api.kcodes.me/claude-faqs/v1/search?q=billing+refund&mode=semantic"
```

Default response shape:

```json
{
  "query": "billing refund",
  "mode": "semantic",
  "count": 2,
  "results": [
    {
      "slug": "request-refund-unexpected-charges",
      "question": "How do I request a refund for unexpected charges?",
      "category": "Billing and Plans FAQ",
      "category_slug": "billing-and-plans-faq",
      "subcategory": "Charges, Refunds, and Support",
      "subcategory_slug": "charges-refunds-and-support",
      "tags": ["refund", "charges", "support"],
      "preview": "Anthropic's official process is through the in-product support messenger...",
      "answered_by": null,
      "last_verified_at": "2026-03-10",
      "source_urls": [
        "https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12386328-requesting-a-refund-for-a-paid-claude-plan"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### `GET /{slug}`

Fetches the full FAQ entry.

Example:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer cfaq_your_key_here" \
  https://api.kcodes.me/claude-faqs/v1/account-banned
```

If the slug does not exist, the API returns a 404 with `did_you_mean` suggestions.

### `GET /{slug}?format=discord`

Returns a Discord embed object.

Example response:

```json
{
  "title": "My account was banned. What can I do?",
  "description": "Anthropic does not publish a public, step-by-step appeal playbook...",
  "color": 7886330,
  "fields": [
    { "name": "Category", "value": "Account Issues FAQ", "inline": true },
    { "name": "Subcategory", "value": "Bans and Suspensions", "inline": true },
    { "name": "Slug", "value": "account-banned", "inline": false },
    { "name": "Last Verified", "value": "2026-03-10", "inline": true }
  ],
  "footer": { "text": "Claude Community FAQ API" }
}
```

That object is designed so bot authors can either:

- send it directly as an embed shape
- map it into their own UI format
- ignore it and use the normal full entry response

### `GET|POST /ask`

Generates a natural-language answer using the FAQ corpus as context.

This endpoint is useful when the user asks a question that does not map neatly to one known slug.

Input options:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer cfaq_your_key_here" \
  "https://api.kcodes.me/claude-faqs/v1/ask?q=how+do+I+request+a+refund"
```

or

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cfaq_your_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question":"how do I request a refund"}' \
  https://api.kcodes.me/claude-faqs/v1/ask
```

Response shape:

```json
{
  "question": "how do I request a refund",
  "answer": "Anthropic's official refund path is through the support messenger...",
  "sources": [
    {
      "slug": "request-refund-unexpected-charges",
      "question": "How do I request a refund for unexpected charges?",
      "source_urls": [
        "https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12386328-requesting-a-refund-for-a-paid-claude-plan"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

If the LLM helper is unavailable, the API falls back to the best FAQ match and sets `fallback: true`.

{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "API key required. Pass via Authorization: Bearer <key> header or ?apikey= parameter."

    }
  ]
}
```

### `429 Rate limit exceeded`

```json

  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "limits": {
    "perMinute": 30,
    "perDay": 1000
  },

  }
}
```

## Client guidance

If you are building your own formatting layer:

- use `/search` for discovery and `/slug` lookup for the final answer
- treat `answer` as markdown-capable plain text
- show `source_urls` for pricing, billing, and support questions whenever possible
- use `last_verified_at` as a freshness hint, not as a legal guarantee
- prefer your own embed or card layout if you need stronger visual consistency than `format=discord`
